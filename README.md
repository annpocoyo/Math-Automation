# Math automation

Automate Mathletics and (WIP) MyiMaths!

## How to use

Download supplied binary that matches your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/annpocoyo/Math-Automation/releases/latest) and place it into a directory of your choosing. This binary already contains everything needed to run except `chromedriver` and Google Chrome.

You will need to download the latest version of [`chromedriver`](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/#stable) from Google and place it in the same directory as the downloaded binary from above.

If there is no binary for your platform you may still run this script by manually downloading the dependencies below and using them to run the scripts.

## Dependencies

If you aren't using the supplied binaries you will need Python and the following programs/modules:

* Selenium (Python Module) - for automating and controlling the browser.
* Chrome - This should be obvious.
* Chromedriver (external program ) - Connecting selenium to Chrome.

## Support

### Mathletics

* ***Integers:***
  * **Evaluation:** Questions that give you an equation and ask you to solve it striaght up.
  * **Positive, Negative or Zero:** Questions that give you an equation and ask if it will equate to an positive or negative number, or zero.
* More will come as I keep getting more and more repetitive homework! :)

### MyiMaths

* Work in Progress (checkout the my_imaths_automation branch and run it to see current progress)
