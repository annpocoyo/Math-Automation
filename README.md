# Math automation

Automate Mathletics and (WIP) MyiMaths!

## Dependencies

You will need Python and the following programs/modules:

* Selenium (Python Module) - for automating and controlling the browser.
* Chrome - This should be obvious.
* Chromedriver (external program ) - Connecting selenium to Chrome.

## Support

### Mathletics

* ***Integers:***
  * **Evaluation:** Questions that give you an equation and ask you to solve it striaght up.
  * **Positive, Negative or Zero:** Questions that give you an equation and ask if it will equate to an positive or negative number, or zero.
* More will come as I keep getting more and more repetitive homework! :)

### MyiMaths

* Work in Progress (checkout the my_imaths_automation branch and run it to see current progress)
